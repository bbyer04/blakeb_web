Orange zest underneath my fingernails, a thin mist of juice covers my desk</p><p>After I finish peeling, all that covers the orange is a thin layer of white pith. I do little to remove the stringy white substance. 'You lose all the vitamins when you take off the white stringers' -- I think back to my grandpa who told me this several years ago</p><p>At last, I tear apart the flesh into its eight pieces</p><p>...</p><p>The thin sticky residue on my workspace and the leftover peel reminds me of the orange long ago digested. After washing my hands for a third time, I conclude: it will be awhile before I eat citrus fruits again.</p>"
