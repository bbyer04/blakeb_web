\section*{Education}

{\large Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience \vspace{0.5em}}\hfill December 2025

\textit{University of Kentucky}

\textit{Minors in Biology, Computer Science, and Mathematics}

\textit{With Honors, 3.95 GPA}

\section*{Experience}

\subsection*{SURE Scholar {\hfill\normalsize\normalfont\ June 2024 -- August 2024}}
\textit{University of North Carolina at Chapel-Hill \vspace{0.5em}}

SURE Scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel-Hill. I studied rare lysosomal storage disease patients
and their COVID-19 outcomes in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C).

\subsection*{Research Assistant {\hfill\normalsize\normalfont\ August 2023 -- Present}}
\textit{University of Kentucky \vspace{0.5em}}

Research Assistant at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. I research polygenic risk scores for 
Alzheimer's disease and statistical fine-mapping for GWAS loci prioritization.

\subsection*{Research Assistant {\hfill\normalsize\normalfont\ January 2023 -- August 2023}}
\textit{University of Kentucky \vspace{0.5em}}

Research Assistant at the Sports Medicine Research Institute at the University of Kentucky College of Health Sciences. 
I contributed to a pilot study that tested wireless motion capture and force-plate insoles for gait retraining of military
personnel. 

\section*{Presentations}
\subsection*{Office of Graduate Education Symposium {\hfill\normalsize\normalfont\ July 2024}}
\textit{University of North Carolina at Chapel-Hill}

Lysosomal storage diseases are not protective against severe COVID-19 infection. Clustering analysis shows that lung disease and lysosomal storage diseases further increase 
infection severity. \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12971921}{10.5281/zenodo.12971921}

\subsection*{Great Lakes Bioinformatics Conference {\hfill\normalsize\normalfont\ May 2024}}
\textit{University of Pittsburgh \vspace{0.5em}}

Averaging polygenic risk scores derived from multiple genome-wide association studies increases predictive accuracy for Alzheimer’s disease.
